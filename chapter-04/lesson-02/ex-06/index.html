      <b>Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies.</b>
      For example, advances in the understanding of
      electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics
      led directly to the development of new products that have
      dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television,
      computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapon
